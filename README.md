# physics-sim
Experimental Project by Sahil Dev

### Motivation
I saw an interesting post, where someone set up initial conditions in a physics environment (say circles making a smiley face) then reversed time (for say, 3 seconds) to get a "random"-looking starting position. Then when time was set to move forward again, it looked like out of the randomness, the starting pattern emerged miraculously in the middle of the simulation, before chaos took over again.

I found that idea fascinating and decided to try implementing my own version.

### How to Run
You should just be able to open the .ipynb file in Jupyter notebook. You will need to install the pygame, pygame-menu, and numpy packages if you have not already.
